Stack currently of Angular, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Applications run in Docker containers.  They are in the process of moving their front-end to React. Currently use Python for data projects and Go is used by their infrastructure team.

# The company: 
A fast growth, highly successful, payments start-up company. They have grown 100% YoY for the past 3 years and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. They are dominant in the UK market and are set to expand in the US and Europe later this year.

The engineering standard is exceptional and everyone, from graduate to CTO has the opportunity to contribute and execute their ideas. Innovation is at the heart of everything they do – they host hackathons, gamedays and encourage POC’s.

# The role: 
You will be part of a small, high performance team that sets the direction of the platform and codebase. You’ll have ownership over your work and you will make decisions around new infrastructure and which technologies are best suited to help the business succeed. You will collaborate with every other team within engineering, from product to data, to drive engineering efforts in the company.
This team ensures that the company can operate effectively across the world, and that they continue to provide a robust, reliable service as they add hundreds of new users every day.
This is the summary of what the team do on a day to day basis:
- Design software to improve availability, scalability and efficiency.
- Solve problems and automate responses for recurrent issues.
- Improve performance through troubleshooting and investigative work.
- Design and implement deployment management for their systems.
- Manage and monitor their platform as it grows.
- Tackle the issues that come your way when you’re on call.
- Create Chef cookbooks to deploy and manage their services.

# Project examples: 
The platform is currently hosted on prem with the view to migrating to a public cloud platform over the next 12 months – which one, to be decided but you’ll have your say in direction. This organisation has had 100% YOY growth for the past 5 years, manages £1billion+ worth of payments a year, processing hundreds of thousands of transactions a day – the next challenge is scaling the payment systems to handle 10 times the current amount. They are investing in infrastructure for improved resilience, and improving the customer experience for first time users of developer APIs and user dashboards.
Some recent projects delivered by the SRE team are:
- Moving to a container-based infrastructure.
- Dealing with the realities of running a relational database at scale.
- Building a high-availability PostgreSQL cluster.
- Improving performance with investigative work.

# What experience is required?
- Experience in a similar role is a must. 
- You must be able to code competently in one of the following languages: Ruby, C, Python, Go.
- Strong operational knowledge of PostgreSQL or similar RDBMS.
- Experience working on a public cloud platform. AWS is the most likely choice for the new platform but GCP ad Azure experience will suffice. The experience is more of a requirement for an understanding how cloud platforms work and can be utilised. 
- Solid Unix/Linux fundamentals.

A finally, a quote from the team themselves:

*"We want to work with people who are always trying to improve and automate processes, who enjoy finding elegant solutions for complex problems, who thrive with new challenges and cryptic issues, who believe there is always something new to learn and that improvement is an iterative process"*
